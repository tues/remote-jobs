# Scalac

## Company blurb

Best Scala hAkkers!

## Company size

50-100 people.

## Remote status

Most people work 100% remotely. You can also work from one of our offices, if you prefer, but we communicate mainly through Slack. Some projects may involve travel - it's something you'll probably discuss during your job interview.

We have an article on [working remotely](https://blog.scalac.io/2015/08/13/working_remotely.html). While it's from 2015, it's still relevant two years later and it explains our culture very well.

## Region

Worldwide. There are no restrictions, especially if you're good at what you do. We have people from different parts of Europe now, so we keep all communication in English.

## Company technologies

We focus on *Scala*, *Akka*, *Play* and the *Lightbend Reactive Platform* in general. For front-end work, we use *React*, *Ember.js*, *Angular* and *Node.js*, among others. We also do mobile development for *Android* and *iOS*.

## Office Locations

Currently, we have two offices in Poland (Gda≈Ñsk and Warsaw), but there may be more in the future. Working there is optional.

There's an up-to-date list of offices at the bottom of [Scalac's home page](https://scalac.io).
